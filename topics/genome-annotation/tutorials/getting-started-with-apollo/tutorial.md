# Background Information

Although it is not the first genome browser, Apollo is the first collaborative genomic annotation editor available solely on the Internet. Apollo is still under development and new features are being added all the time.

> ### {% icon details %} Important Definitions 
> * **Static:** Unmodifiable, specifically in the context of a computer resource that you are accessing. The website that you see cannot be modified by you, the user accessing them. This is opposed to “dynamic” where you can interact with the files or service, and your interactions can persist.
> * **Instance:** A specific copy of a web service made available over the internet. Given that the administrators can run many copies of the same web service, we use the term “instance” to refer to a specific copy of a service.
> * **Tracks:** In Apollo, a track is a set of analysis results that can be shown or hidden depending on the annotator’s needs. All tracks are stored in a file format that allows them to be aligned to the organisms's DNA sequence.
> * **Evidence:** Tracks contain evidence; these are results of specific computer methods (which are documented and citable), which we use to make annotations. Annotations should not be made without evidence. Evidence allows us to move the annotation process from an art to a science.
> * **Feature:** Conceptually, a feature is any defined and named region of a genome. Features could be genes, conserved domains, promoter binding sites, terminators, intron splice sites, or any other region of interest. Visually, a features appear as rectangular boxes in Apollo.
> * **Annotations:** Annotation is the addition of descriptive features to a DNA sequence, such as a protein’s function, or locating tRNAs, and terminators. The annotation process we do is 100% computer based, so keep in mind that until an annotation is experimentally tested in the lab, it is putative or assumed based on an educated hypothesis.

## History of Genome Browsers

This section will cover a bit of history about Genome Browsers. While not useful to the annotation process, it is important to know what the terms mean and how the parts all fit together, so that the developers and annotators can have a common language.

We use a lot of software under the umbrella term of GMOD, the [Generic Model Organism Database.](http://www.gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page “Generic Model Organism Database”)

GMOD is a collection of open source software for maintaining Model Organism Databases (MODs). Having a common platform for MODs is important, as historically individual labs spent effort building their own, custom organism databases, and then faced challenges trying to interoperate with other databases. With GMOD and the associated tools, software that talks to one MOD can be re-used when talking to another MOD. We can use the same tools to work with the CPT’s Phage Database, as people use to access data in Yeast genome databases.


### 1. GBrowse

One of the earlier genome browsers, GBrowse did *not* support annotation. Think of it like the old Yahoo-maps. Instead of just clicking and dragging the map, you had to click where you wanted to go, wait a few seconds, and the new map would be displayed. It makes the process tedious.

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/3_gbrowse_from_gmod_wiki.png)

### 2. JBrowse

JBrowse is used in Galaxy workflows for genome visualization. JBrowse is a more modern re-implementation of GBrowse. JBrowse is much more like Google Maps (or any other current web map service); you click and drag and can quickly browse around the genome, turning evidence tracks on and off where relevant. Many labs have deployed JBrowse instances to help showcase their annotation efforts to the community, and to make their data accessible. FlyBase has produced a demo in JBrowse, displaying *Drosophila melanogaster*. Note that JBrowse is a **_static_** visualization tool. You cannot make any changes to the data, and you cannot make annotations and save them. It is a “Read Only” view of genomes and annotations.

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/4_jbrowse.png)

### 3. Apollo

Apollo takes JBrowse one step further and adds support for community annotation; it provides a “Read+Write” view of genomes. You can create new annotations on new gene features, and these are shared with everyone who has access to the Apollo server. From a computer perspective, Apollo embeds a copy of JBrowse. For the annotation workflow, we will use both Apollo and JBrowse.

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/5_compare_and_contrast_browsers.png)

### 4. Stand-alone tools: Artemis

Many genome browsers and annotators are installed and store thier data on your local computer. Artemis, produced by the Sanger Institute, is a powerful and freely-available desktop-based genome browser and annotation tool. Artemis is written in Java and so it can be run on Windows, Mac and Linux-based systems.  Artemis provides a three-pane view consisting of a high-level overview of the genome, a DNA-level view, and a list of all the features in the genome. Unlike Apollo, all data is only stored on your local device. 

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/2_artemis.png)

Artemis is capable of adding, deleting and editing genome features and annotations, and also has limited ability to edit DNA sequence directly. Features are not added from evidence tracks but may be entered by the user directly, which allows for great flexibility but also means that evidence for each annotation is not tied to the record itself. 

In BICH 464, we will not be using Artemis for the annotation of your genomes.  However, Artemis is useful for viewing genomes retrieved from the public databases such as NCBI GenBank. Artemis is able to directly read GenBank-formatted files downloaded from the internet.  We will cover Artemis on an individual basis later in the course.


# Annotation Within Apollo

Continuing on to actually using Apollo, this section will go through an example annotation. Characteristics of the program will also be described to assist in the navigation of the program. There are two primary components to annotation:

1. Structural annotation, which consists of locations of genomic features, such as genes and terminators. Several gene callers will identify possible genes in the phage genome. Putative genes in Apollo will be annotated based on these results. See the [Structural Annotation Workflow Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}//topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/structural-annotation-workflow/tutorial.html) for more information. 
2. Functional annotation, which entails predicting gene functions based on multiple sources of evidence. To run the analyses to allow this prediction see the [Functional Annotation Workflow Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}//topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/functional-annotation-workflow/tutorial.html).

## Apollo in Galaxy - General Use

### 1. JBrowse in Galaxy

The CPT developed a tool called JBrowse-in-Galaxy (JiG), which allows the building of JBrowse instances within Galaxy; this contrasts with how JBrowse instances are traditionally configured, through a complex and manual process at the command line. 

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/14_jbrowse_in_galaxy.png)

The CPT uses JBrowse as a tool for displaying the results of a bioinformatic analysis in a standardized way; instead of having to digest and understand 20+ different report formats, images, output files, tables, etc., all of our analyses are presented as easy-to-grasp features in evidence tracks. As its input, Apollo takes complete JBrowse instances. To view any data in Apollo, a JBrowse instance needs to be configured first. On the far left side of the Galaxy web page is a “Tools” column with a search bar. Search [“JBrowse genome browser”](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy/root?tool_id=jbrowse) and click on the synonymous link underneath “CPT: Genomic Viz.”

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/15_jbrowse_instance_setup.png)

It is vital that the correct files are elected for the steps in the tool, otherwise the tool will not run. Once you’v created a JBrowse instance, it will appear in the history column on the left side of the Galaxy page. To see the JBrowse instance, click on the corresponding eyeball {% icon solution %} symbol; clicking on the JBrowse instance step will reveal more details and options. If desired, clicking on the floppy disk symbol will save the JBrowse instance to the local device. This is typically unnecessary, as it will remain stored within the Galaxy history.

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/16_jbrowse_instance_within_galaxy.png)

### 2. Moving Data From Galaxy to Apollo

With a complete JBrowse instance, data can now be channeled to Apollo. Data is built up in Galaxy in the form of a JBrowse instance, which is then pushed to the Apollo service in the *Create or Update Organism* step. Once annotations have been made on the organism’s genome in Apollo, the updated set of annotations can be exported into Galaxy, and then re-analyzed for another update in Apollo with the new results.

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/17_apollo_galaxy_jbrowse_general_workflow.png "General Apollo/JiG/Galaxy workflow")

**Create or Update Organism** is a tool that allows for the creation/updating of an organism in Apollo with new data from Galaxy in the form of a JBrowse instance. The [Create or Update Organism](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy/root?tool_id=edu.tamu.cpt2.webapollo.create_or_update) tool can be found using the search function in the Tools column in Galaxy, underneath “CPT: Apollo.”

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/18_create_or_update_organism.png)

> ### {% icon tip %} Note that…
> You **_must_** fill out the Organism Common Name. If the phage is “P22,” it is recommended that
>    > * If possible, the FASTA file header reads *>P22* (and nothing else), and
>    > * “P22” is typed into the Organism Common name field in this tool.
> Like with the JBrowse Instance tool, if the fields are not filled correctly, the tool will *not* run, or will run *incorrectly*.
{: .tip}

Executing this step will transfer data to Apollo and produce a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. The output JSON file contains some metadata about the organism. With the data available in Apollo, it can be accessed at [Apollo](https://cpt.tamu.edu/apollo/annotator/index); accessing Apollo requires logging into Galaxy. The genome can also be accessed via the “Annotate on data #” step in the history column by clicking the eye {% icon solution %} symbol. The Annotate tool takes the JSON file from the **Create or Update Organism** step and loads Apollo directly in Galaxy.

### Navigating Through Apollo

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/19_jbrowse_embedded_in_apollo.png)

> ### {% icon tip %} Maximizing Screen Space
> Having the gene tracks on in combination with the Apollo panel and the Galaxy columns can be overwhelming and distracting from the annotation. 
> * Small arrows in the bottom right corner of the History column and in the bottom left corner of the Tools column can be toggled to collapse the Galaxy columns and further expand the Apollo annotation screen. 
> * Clicking the arrow near the top right corner of the Apollo panel will close the right pane. 
> Display of the Available Tracks column on the left can be toggled by clicking the menu/hamburger icon on the right upper side.
> * The width for both side panels in Apollo can be adjusted by clicking and dragging the edge of the panel. 
> * Additionally, zooming down to the single gene level can greatly assist in focusing on annotation. 
{: .tip}

As depicted above, Apollo will present a two-pane display, surrounded by the Galaxy Tools and History columns on the left and right, respectively. On the left is an embedded JBrowse instance, and on the right is the Apollo annotator panel. JBrowse as embedded in Apollo is *slightly* different than a normal JBrowse; however, the movement controls are all the same:
> * the magnifying glasses will zoom in (+)/out (-) of the genome and its data.
> * the arrow icons will move upstream/downstream along the genome.
> * clicking/dragging on the red outlined box on the genome ruler (light grey box toward the top of the page, 0bp; 12,500 bp; 25,000 bp; etc.) will move to specific regions.
> * clicking/dragging anywhere else on the genome ruler will allow movement and zooming into that specific region.

> ### {% icon tip %} Enhance Viewing Experience
> The menu bar at the top has useful options, some that aren’t available in “standard” JBrowse. **View** offers helpful adjustments to observing the genome within Apollo
> * “Color by CDS frame” is a popular option during annotation. It colors each coding sequence based on which reading frame it is in.
> * “Show Track label” facilitates annotation by removing the track’s labeling at the far left of the embedded JBrowse window. This allows for annotation of small features near the end of the genome, which would otherwise be hidden by the track label (e.g. “User-created annotations).
{: .tip}

The pale yellow track that is visible across the screen below the navigation controls is the User Created Annotations track. The called genes and other features exist here. Since gene features will be added to this track and edited, this track will *always* be visible.

In the Apollo panel on the right, there is a drop-down menu called the Genome Selector, and it will list all organisms available to the account in use.

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/20_genome_selector.png)![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/21_genome_selector_options.png)

Apollo uses the concept of ‘Organisms’ with ‘reference sequences’ below it. Each organism can have one or more reference sequences. In higher order organisms, those often correspond to multiple chromosomes. For phage uses they are most often used to correspond to different assemblies of the genome. For most projects, **only organisms with a single reference sequence will be worked on.**

On the left side of the embedded JBrowse instance is a checklist-like column titled “Available Tracks”. Here the evidence tracks currently available for the genome being analyzed are listed. Evidence tracks will appear upon the execution of structural and functional workflows, as well as other custom analyses.
The first evidence tracks used will be those from the structural workflow: *GeneMarkS*, *MetaGeneAnnotator*, and *Glimmer3*. Selecting these will display predicted genes below the User-Created Annotations Track.

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/22_zoomed_out_gene_tracks.png)

![](../../images/getting-started-with-apollo-screenshots/23_zoomed_in_gene_tracks.png)

> ### {% icon tip %} Note that…
> The examples above already have genes called in the User Created Annotations track; the phage P22 genome is already annotated. This **_will not_** be the case for a novel phage genome.
{: .tip}

At that level, comparison of the three gene models may occur to determine possible genes. Only one gene in the *MetaGeneAnnotator* track has an annotated Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence; the CPT filters all SD sequences to ensure only the high-quality sequences are visible. If an undesirable feature has been created/annotated, right-clicking on the feature will display many options; select “Delete.”

All changes made are instantaneously and immediately saved.

## Workflows

There are at least two standard workflows in the phage annotation pipeline that are run in Galaxy to allow annotation in Apollo. The first covers [structural annotation]({{ site.baseurl }}//topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/structural-annotation-workflow/tutorial.html) (genes, terminators, tRNAs), and the second starts the [functional annotation]({{ site.baseurl }}//topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/functional-annotation-workflow/tutorial.html) (BLAST, InterProScan, other protein databases).
